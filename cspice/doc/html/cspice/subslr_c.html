   method      is a short string providing parameters defining 
               the computation method to be used.  
 
               The supported values of `method' are listed below. 
               Please note that the colon is a required delimiter; 
               using a blank will not work. 
 
                  &quot;Near point: ellipsoid&quot;   The sub-solar point 
                                            computation uses a 
                                            triaxial ellipsoid to 
                                            model the surface of the 
                                            target body. The 
                                            sub-solar point is 
                                            defined as the nearest 
                                            point on the target 
                                            relative to the Sun.  
 
                  &quot;Intercept: ellipsoid&quot;    The sub-solar point 
                                            computation uses a 
                                            triaxial ellipsoid to 
                                            model the surface of the 
                                            target body. The 
                                            sub-solar point is 
                                            defined as the target 
                                            surface intercept of the 
                                            line containing the 
                                            Sun and the 
                                            target's center. 
 
               Neither case nor white space are significant in 
               `method'. For example, the string  
 
                 &quot; nearpoint:ELLIPSOID &quot; 
 
               is valid. 
 
                
   target      is the name of the target body. The target body is  
               an ephemeris object (its trajectory is given by 
               SPK data), and is an extended object. 
 
               The string `target' is case-insensitive, and leading 
               and trailing blanks in `target' are not significant. 
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the 
               integer ID code for the object. For example both 
               &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate 
               the Moon is the target body. 
 
               When the target body's surface is represented by a 
               tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a 
               kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is 
               present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel 
               variable would be defined by loading a PCK file. 
 
 
   et          is the epoch of participation of the observer, 
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is 
               the epoch at which the observer's state is computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also 
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of 
               the target body and the position of the Sun are computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are used, `et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's state relative to the solar
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the position
               and orientation of the target body are computed at
               et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time between the
               sub-solar point and the observer. See the description of
               `abcorr' below for details.
 
 
   fixref      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the target body. The output
               sub-solar point `spoint' will be expressed relative to
               this reference frame. The string `fixref' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `fixref' are not significant.
 
                
   abcorr      indicates the aberration correction to be applied when
               computing the target position and orientation, and the
               position of the Sun.
        
               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent 
               sub-solar point seen by the observer is desired, 
               normally either of the corrections  
             
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;  
                  &quot;CN+S&quot; 
    
               should be used. These and the other supported options 
               are described below. `abcorr' may be any of the  
               following: 
 
                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the  
                             geometric sub-solar point on the 
                             target body. 
 
               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the 
               observer and the sub-solar point (note: NOT 
               between the observer and the target body's center). 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the 
               sub-solar point's location at the light-time 
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's 
               location at `et': 
 
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also 
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a 
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction 
                             yields the location of sub-solar 
                             point at the moment it emitted photons 
                             arriving at the observer at `et'. 
  
                             The light time correction uses an 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation. The solution invoked by the 
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration. 

                             The target position and orientation as
                             seen by the observer are corrected for
                             light time. The position of the Sun
                             relative to the target is corrected for
                             one-way light time between the Sun and
                             target.
 
 
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                             This option modifies the sub-solar point
                             obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to account
                             for the observer's velocity relative to
                             the solar system barycenter. These
                             corrections yield the apparent
                             sub-solar point.

 
                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time 
                             correction. In solving the light time 
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates 
                             until the solution converges. Both the 
                             position and rotation of the target 
                             body, and the position of the Sun,
                             are corrected for light time. 
 
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time and 
                             stellar aberration corrections. This 
                             option produces a solution that is at 
                             least as accurate at that obtainable 
                             with the &quot;LT+S&quot; option. Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; 
                             solution is substantially more accurate 
                             depends on the geometry of the 
                             participating objects and on the 
                             accuracy of the input data. In all 
                             cases this routine will execute more 
                             slowly when a converged solution is 
                             computed. 

                Neither case nor white space are significant in
                `abcorr'. For example, the string

                  'Lt + s'

                is valid.

 
   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. The observing body 
               is an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft, 
               the earth, or a surface point on the earth. `obsrvr' is 
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in 
               `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may 
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for 
               the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are 
               legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the 
               observer.

   spoint      is the sub-solar point on the target body. 
 
               The sub-solar point is defined either as the point 
               on the target body that is closest to the Sun, 
               or the target surface intercept of the line from the 
               Sun to the target's center; the input argument 
               `method' selects the definition to be used.  
 
               `spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates, 
               relative to the body-fixed target frame designated by 
               `fixref'. The body-fixed target frame is evaluated at 
               the sub-solar epoch `trgepc' (see description below). 
 
               When light time correction is used, the duration of 
               light travel between `spoint' to the observer is 
               considered to be the one way light time. 
 
               When aberration corrections are used, `spoint' is 
               computed using target body position and orientation 
               that have been adjusted for the corrections 
               applicable to `spoint' itself rather than to the target 
               body's center. In particular, if the stellar 
               aberration correction applicable to `spoint' is 
               represented by a shift vector `s', then the light-time 
               corrected position of the target is shifted by `s'
               before the sub-solar point is computed. 
                
               The components of `spoint' have units of km. 
 
 
   trgepc      is the &quot;sub-solar point epoch.&quot; `trgepc' is defined 
               as follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time 
               between the observer and the sub-solar point, 
               `trgepc' is either the epoch et-lt or `et' depending on 
               whether the requested aberration correction is, 
               respectively, for received radiation or omitted. `lt' is 
               computed using the method indicated by `abcorr'. 
 
               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. 
 
 
   srfvec      is the vector from the observer's position at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
               position of `spoint', where the aberration corrections
               are specified by `abcorr'. `srfvec' is expressed in the
               target body-fixed reference frame designated by
               `fixref', evaluated at `trgepc'.

 
               The components of `srfvec' are given in units of km. 
 
               One can use the CSPICE function <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> to obtain the 
               distance between the observer and `spoint': 
 
                  dist = <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> ( srfvec );
 
               The observer's position `obspos', relative to the 
               target body's center, where the center's position is 
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by 
               `abcorr', can be computed via the call: 
 
                  <a href="vsub_c.html">vsub_c</a> ( spoint, srfvec, obspos );
 
               To transform the vector `srfvec' to a time-dependent 
               reference frame `ref' at `et', a sequence of two frame 
               transformations is required. For example, let `mfix' 
               and `mref' be 3x3 matrices respectively describing the 
               target body-fixed to J2000 frame transformation at 
               `trgepc' and the J2000 to (time-dependent frame) `ref' 
               transformation at `et', and let `xform' be the 3x3 matrix 
               representing the composition of `mref' with `mfix'. Then 
               `srfvec' can be transformed to the result `refvec' as 
               follows: 
 
                   <a href="pxform_c.html">pxform_c</a> ( fixref,  &quot;j2000&quot;, trgepc, mfix   );
                   <a href="pxform_c.html">pxform_c</a> ( &quot;j2000&quot;, ref,     et,     mref   );
                   <a href="mxm_c.html">mxm_c</a>    ( mref,    mfix,            xform  );
                   <a href="mxv_c.html">mxv_c</a>    ( xform,   srfvec,          refvec );

   1)  If the specified aberration correction is relativistic or
       calls for stellar aberration but not light time correction,
       the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. If the specified 
       aberration correction is any other unrecognized value, the 
       error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call 
       tree of this routine.  

   2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
       converted to an integer ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
       is signaled.
 
   3)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID code, 
       the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If the input target body-fixed frame `fixref' is not recognized,
       the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame name may fail
       to be recognized because a required frame specification kernel
       has not been loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the 
       frame name.
 
   5)  If the input frame `fixref' is not centered at the target body,
       the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

   6)  If the input argument `method' is not recognized, the error 
       SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled. 

   7)  If the target and observer have distinct identities but are
       at the same location (for example, the target is Mars and
       the observer is the Mars barycenter), the error 
       SPICE(NOSEPARATION) is signaled.

   8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to 
       calling <b>subslr_c</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a 
       routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when 
       light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data 
       must be available to propagate the states of observer,
       target, and the Sun to the solar system barycenter. 
 
   9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target shape
       and triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded 
       into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>subslr_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 
 
   10) The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of  
       the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed 
       and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
  
   11) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame orientation
       have not been loaded prior to calling <b>subslr_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 

   12) The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if any input string
       argument does not contain at least one character, since the
       input string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in
       this case.
      
   13) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if any input
       string argument pointer is null.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called.
 
   The following data are required: 
 
      - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the Sun must
        be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
        ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
        files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - PCK data: if the target body shape is modeled as an 
        ellipsoid, triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded 
        into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a 
        text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be 
        loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file. 
 
      - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the 
        observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the 
        target, that definition must be available in the kernel 
        pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a 
        frame kernel via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program 
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar point:
   &quot;nearest point on the target to the Sun&quot; or &quot;target surface
   intercept of the line containing the Sun and the target.&quot; These
   coincide when the target is spherical and generally are distinct
   otherwise.
 
   This routine computes light time corrections using light time
   between the observer and the sub-solar point, as opposed to the
   center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration corrections done
   by this routine are based on the direction of the vector from the
   observer to the light-time corrected sub-solar point, not to the
   target center. This technique avoids errors due to the differential
   between aberration corrections across the target body. Therefore
   it's valid to use aberration corrections with this routine even when
   the observer is very close to the sub-solar point, in particular
   when the observer to sub-solar point distance is much less than the
   observer to target center distance.
 
   The definition of the aberration-corrected sub-solar point is
   implicit: `spoint' is defined by an equation of the general form
 
      spoint = f ( spoint ) 
 
   Because of the contraction properties of both light time and 
   stellar aberration corrections---that is, the difference in the 
   corrections for two vectors is much smaller than the difference 
   between the vectors themselves---it's easy to solve this equation 
   accurately and fairly quickly. 
    
   When comparing sub-solar point computations with results from 
   sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same 
   geometric definitions are used.

   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across 
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as 
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine  
   specific arithmetic implementation.  


   1) Find the sub-solar point on Mars as seen from the Earth for a
      specified time. Perform the computation twice, using both the
      &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;near point&quot; options. Display the locations of
      the Sun and the sub-solar point using both planetocentric
      and planetographic coordinates.
