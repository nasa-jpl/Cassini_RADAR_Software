Dynamically Linked Executables
 
   For some environments precompiled executables provided in the generic
   Toolkit packages and additional utility program executables provided on
   the Utilities page on the NAIF Web site
   (http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/utilities.html) are dynamically linked
   and, in order to run, require certain dynamic libraries, usually
   provided with the compiler used to build the executables, to be
   installed on the user's system. This applies to most Mac/OSX, PC/Linux
   and Sun/Solaris environments.

SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy/Mice
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Kernel Pool Variable Name Length Check
 
   The routines loading SPICE text kernel files now include a check on the
   length of the kernel pool variable names. The error SPICE(BADVARNAME) is
   signaled if the length of any variable provided in the text kernel file
   exceeds 32 characters. Regardless of language, all Toolkits inherit this
   behavior.
 
 
CK Buffered Segment Limits
 
   The maximum number of CK segments that can be buffered simultaneously
   has been increased to 50000.
 
 
SPK Buffered Segment Limits
 
   The maximum number of SPK segments that can be buffered simultaneously
   has been increased to 50000.
 
 
Kernel Pool Double Precision Buffer Limit
 
   The maximum number of double precision values that can be stored in the
   kernel pool has been increased to 200000.
 
 
SCLK Coefficient Record Limit
 
   The maximum number of SCLK coefficient records that can be buffered has
   been increased to 50000. This is also the limit on the number of
   coefficient records that can be stored in an SCLK kernel.

      CKW03 (ckw03_c in CSPICE) (cspice_ckw03 in Icy and Mice)
      CKW05 (ckw05_c in CSPICE)
 
   has been relaxed from checking for a magnitude ``close'' to 1 to simply
   ensuring that the input quaternions are non-zero.

Overwriting Input Arguments Not Allowed
 
   The following SPICELIB routines were designed to allow applications to
   call them in such a way that input arguments could overwrite output
   arguments. However, this usage is a violation of the Fortran 77
   standard; it also causes failures in some environments when SPICELIB is
   compiled with optimization (currently SPICELIB is optimized only for
   Intel Fortran environments). So, the header documentation of affected
   SPICELIB routines has been updated to not suggest this calling
   technique. The affected routines are:
 
      CYCLAD  CYCLAI  DUCRSS  DVCRSS  INVERT  INVSTM  MTXM
      MTXV    MXM     MXMT    MXV     PACKAC  PACKAD  PACKAI
      ROTMAT  ROTVEC  SAELGV  UNORM   UNORMG  VADD    VADDG
      VCRSS   VHATG   VMINUG  VMINUS  VPROJ   VPROJG  VSCL
      VSCLG   VSUB    VSUBG   XPOSBL  XPOSE   XPOSEG
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Kernel Pool Watcher Deletion in TKFRAM
 
   The watcher deletion algorithm has been corrected to delete watchers
   only when the variables they watch are dumped from the local buffer.
 
 
Frame Change in CKGP
 
   CKGP now computes the transformation from the requested frame to the
   applicable CK segment's base frame via a call to REFCHG. Formerly CKGP
   performed this transformation using FRMCHG, which required that angular
   velocity data describing the relative motion of these frames be
   available.
 
 
ROTGET Dynamic Frame ID
 
   ROTGET formerly passed the frame class ID rather than the frame ID to
   private routine ZZDYNROT, which handles dynamic frame transformations.
   Since by convention these IDs are identical for dynamic frames, the
   error had no practical effect. The error has been corrected. The shadow
   private routine ZZROTGT0 has been corrected as well. Note that the error
   does not apply to the second-level private shadow routine ZZROTGT1.
 
 
ZZEKQCON Initialization Error
 
   The private routine ZZEKQCON could in some cases access uninitialized
   variables when working with null column entries. This has been
   corrected.
 
 
ZZEKRD03 Memory Violation Error
 
   The private routine ZZEKRD03 had a bug that caused it to overwrite local
   memory. Prior to the N0064 version of SPICELIB, this error had been
   benign on all supported platforms. The error has been corrected.
 
 
EK Strings Longer Than 1024 Characters
 
   Although the EK Required Reading states that variable-length strings in
   EK columns are limited to 1024 characters in length, the EK writer
   routines don't enforce this limit, and some users have created kernels
   that violate the limit. Various routines that support EK query and fetch
   operations had assumed that the limit was in effect and were subject to
   substring boundary violations when these long strings were encountered.
   In addition, the semantics of string comparisons for excessively long
   strings were undefined.
 
   A compromise solution was selected: EK routines that perform
   variable-length EK column entry string comparisons now treat only the
   first 1024 characters of strings as significant.
 
   The following private routines were updated to effect this change:
 
      ZZEKECMP
      ZZEKFRX
      ZZEKSCMP
      ZZEKVMCH
 
   This fix also corrects the substring boundary violations.
 
 
RETURN Mode Logic in Various Routines
 
   The following routines were corrected to ensure that they avoid making
   branch decisions based on uninitialized data after encountering a SPICE
   error while in RETURN mode:
 
      ILUMIN
      SPKAPO
      SPKEZ
      SUBPNT
      SUBSLR
      ZZSPKEZ0
      ZZSPKEZ1

Geometry Finder (GF) Subsystem
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0063 version offers the first official release of the initial set
   of the SPICE Geometry Finder (GF) subsystem interfaces. The GF subsystem
   answers questions such as:
 
       --   find the time(s) or time span(s) when a selected orbital
            geometric condition is "true" (e.g. a condition such as an
            occultation or transit)
 
       --   find the time(s) or time span(s) when a specified geometric
            quantity, such as range or phase angle, is within a specified
            range.
 
   The GF Required Reading document, gf.req, provides a comprehensive
   description of the GF subsystem and its high-, mid-, and low-level APIs
   and includes numerous usage examples.
 
   For your convenience, the language-specific high-level GF APIs included

SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy/Mice
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
SURFPV/surfpv_c (SPICELIB/CSPICE only)
 
   The SURFPV routine (surfpv_c in SPICE) finding the state (position and
   velocity) of the surface intercept defined by a specified ray, ray
   velocity, and ellipsoid was added to the Toolkit.
 
 
DVSEP/dvsep_c (SPICELIB/CSPICE only)
 
   The DVSEP function (dvsep_c in CSPICE) calculating the time derivative
   of the separation angle between two input states was added to the
   Toolkit.
 
 
GETFOV
 
   The header of the GETFOV routine (getfov_c in CSPICE, cspice_getfov in
   Icy and Mice) was updated to provide a comprehensive specification of
   the IK keywords used to define FOVs and to include more practical
   examples of FOV definitions.
 
 
FURNSH
 
   The FURNSH routine (furnsh_c in CSPICE, cspice_furnsh in Icy and Mice)
   was updated to support continued path values and to reject files with
   names longer than 255 characters.
 
 
Improved Error Messages from PXFORM/SXFORM
 
   The formerly rather cryptic error messages ``There is insufficient
   information available to transform from ... to frame ....'' generated by
   PXFORM/SXFORM (pxform_c/sxform_c in CSPICE, cspice_pxform/cspice_sxform
   in Icy and Mice) have been improved to provide more context and to
   suggest what SPICE data may be missing.
 
 
Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
 
   The following new built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been added
   to the Toolkit:
 
      Spacecraft:
 
              -5    PLC
              -5    PLANET-C
              -68   MMO
              -68   MERCURY MAGNETOSPHERIC ORBITER
              -69   MPO
              -69   MERCURY PLANETARY ORBITER
             -140   EPOCH
             -140   DIXI
 
      Asteroids:
 
          2002867   STEINS
 
 
 
Mice (MATLAB interface to CSPICE) Only
--------------------------------------------------------

New and Updated Applications
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
FRMDIFF
 
   The FRMDIFF program was added to the application set included in each
   SPICE toolkit. This program samples orientation of a reference frame
   known to SPICE or computes differences between orientations of two
   reference frames known to SPICE, and either displays this orientation or
   these differences, or shows statistics about it or them.
 
   Refer to the FRMDIFF User's Guide, frmdiff.ug, for more information
   about the program.
 
 
CKBRIEF
 
   The CKBRIEF program was updated to display names of the frames
   associated with CK IDs when the new command line option ``-n'' is
   specified. The help information that the program displays when the
   command line option ``-h'' is specified was updated for clarity and
   contents.
 
 
Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Language Specific Required Reading Documents
 
   The following Required Reading documents have been adapted for Icy and
   Mice:
 
      gf.req
      frames.req
      kernel.req
      naif_ids.req
      time.req
      windows.req
 
 
CKBRIEF User's Guide
 
   The CKBRIEF User's Guide, ckbrief.ug, was fully rewritten to describe
   new features added to the program and to provide examples illustrating
   all aspects of the program's functionality.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
SINCPT, SRFXPT
 
   The routines SINCPT and SRFXPT were modified to not perform the quick
   test for non-intersection when observer-target distance is less than
   target's maximum radius.
 
 
POOL Watchers
 
   A new POOL entry point DWPOOL (delete watch from pool) has been added.
   This routine deletes a specified agent from all POOL data structures
   that associate kernel variables and agents.
 
   Watcher overflow detection logic has been corrected in SWPOOL.
 
   In the following routines, watched kernel variables are no longer
   considered to be buffered when a lookup of one of these variables fails:
 
      BODC2N (via changes to ZZBODTRN)
      BODDEF (via changes to ZZBODTRN)
      BODN2C (via changes to ZZBODTRN)
      SCPART
      SCTYPE
      SCTK01 (SC01 entry point)
      SCFM01 (SC01 entry point)
      SCTE01 (SC01 entry point)
      SCET01 (SC01 entry point)
      SCEC01 (SC01 entry point)
      TTRANS
      UNITIM
 
 
Frame subsystem
 
   TKFRAM has been updated to use DWPOOL when it deletes a frame
   specification from its internal buffer; this corrects a bug that caused
   the watcher system to overflow when a large number of TK frame
   specifications were used.
 
 
Error handling
 
   OUTMSG has been updated so that it correctly displays very long strings
   that have been substituted into the long error message.
 
 
Non-printing Character Detection in Time System
 
   The low-level time string parser routines called by STR2ET (str2et_c in
   CSPICE, cspice_str2et in Icy and Mice), UTC2ET (utc2et_c in CSPICE,
   cspice_utc2et in Icy and Mice), and TPARSE (tparse_c in CSPICE,
   cspice_tparse in Icy and Mice) were updated to detect non-printing
   characters with ASCII codes greater than 126.
 
 
MKSPK
 
   The program was updated to prevent signaling an error due to round off
   in the computed time step when creating Type 8 or Type 12 SPK files.
 
 
CKBRIEF
 
   Two bugs in CKRBIEF were fixed: hanging up when no value is provided
   after the ``-f'' option and displaying a warning message and an
   incomplete summary in case of an insufficient buffer space. In the
   latter case the program now displays an error message.

Mice
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0062 version offers the first official release of Mice, the ANSI
   based interface between the MATLAB environment, a product of Mathworks,
   Inc. (http://www.mathworks.com), and the CSPICE library. If you
   downloaded a Mice package, refer to ``mice.req'' document and to the
   Mice HTML documentation pointed to by ``doc/html/index.html'' for more
   details.
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy/Mice
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New ``Surface Intercept'' routine SINCPT
 
   Given an observer and a direction vector defining a ray, the new routine
   SINCPT (sincpt_c in CSPICE, cspice_sincpt in Icy and Mice) computes the
   surface intercept of the ray on a target body at a specified epoch,
   optionally corrected for light time and stellar aberration. This routine
   supersedes SRFXPT (srfxpt_c, cspice_srfxpt), which does not have an
   input argument for the target body-fixed frame name.
 
 
New ``Illumination Angles'' routine ILUMIN
 
   The new routine ILUMIN (ilumin_c in CSPICE, cspice_ilumin in Icy and
   Mice) finds the illumination angles (phase, solar incidence, and
   emission) at a specified surface point of a target body. This routine
   supersedes ILLUM (illum_c, cspice_illum), which doesn't have an input
   argument for the target body-fixed frame name.
 
 
New ``Sub-observer Point'' routine SUBPNT
 
   The new routine SUBPNT (subpnt_c in CSPICE, cspice_subpnt in Icy and
   Mice) computes the rectangular coordinates of the sub-observer point on
   a target body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light time
   and stellar aberration. This routine supersedes SUBPT (subpt_c,
   cspice_subpt), which does not have an input argument for the target
   body-fixed frame name.
 
 
New ``Sub-solar Point'' Routine SUBSLR
 
   The new routine SUBSLR (subslr_c in CSPICE, cspice_subslr in Icy and
   Mice) computes the rectangular coordinates of the sub-solar point on a
   target body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light time
   and stellar aberration. This routine supersedes SUBSOL (subsol_c,
   cspice_subsol), which does not have an input argument for the target
   body-fixed frame name.
 
 
Improvements of Aberration Corrected Velocity in the SPK Subsystem
 
   NAIF has upgraded the algorithms used by the SPICE Toolkit's SPK
   subsystem to improve the accuracy of certain velocity results returned
   by that subsystem. The new algorithms improve the accuracy of velocities
   that are corrected for light time alone, or both light time and stellar
   aberration. The new algorithms use the same non-relativistic models for
   aberration corrections as do the current SPK algorithms, but the new
   implementations of the velocity calculations are more accurate.
 
   The changes improve the accuracy of certain derived quantities,
   including range rates and times of periapse or apoapse, when aberration
   corrections are used. These changes improve current SPICE computations
   as well as being necessary for implementation of the upcoming geometric
   event finding subsystem.
 
   The changes do not affect the computation of aberration-corrected
   position vectors, nor do they affect uncorrected (``geometric'') states
   (position and velocity).
 
   A few examples of the magnitudes of improvements afforded by the new
   algorithms are shown below. All velocities are inertially referenced.
 
       --   Range rate of the light time corrected position of the Moon as
            seen from the DSN station DSS-25: 1 cm/sec
 
       --   Range rate of the light time and stellar aberration corrected
            position of the Moon as seen from DSS-25: 13 cm/sec
 
       --   Range rate of the light time corrected position of Mars as seen
            from DSS-25: 55 cm/sec
 
       --   Range rate of the light time and stellar aberration corrected
            position of Mars as seen from DSS-25: 1.6 m/sec
 
       --   Range rate of the light time corrected position of Cassini as
            seen from DSS-25: 9 cm/sec
 
       --   Range rate of the light time and stellar aberration corrected
            position of Cassini as seen from DSS-25: 3.4 m/sec
 
       --   Velocity of the Neptune barycenter, as seen from DSS-25,
            corrected for light time: 25 cm/sec
 
       --   Velocity of the Neptune barycenter, as seen from DSS-25,
            corrected for light time and stellar aberration: 400 m/sec
 
   Negative effects of the changes are
 
       --   Velocity computations using stellar aberration corrections are
            slower; the extent of the effect varies considerably depending
            on the inputs to the computations, but tests indicate that some
            common computations would be slower by a factor of 2.
 
   But take note: since computation of aberration-corrected states is
   usually a small fraction of the computational workload of SPICE-based
   applications, the effect on the speed of SPICE-based applications is
   very small, and in a majority of cases would likely not be discernible
   at all.
 
   Also note, the effect on speed of an application that simply ``reads''
   state vectors from an SPK file is nil since aberration corrections are
   not used for this purpose.
 
       --   Using the upgraded algorithms would change outputs of some
            SPICE-based user applications. In these situations, a user's
            regression tests could be affected.
 
       --   If a user's application counts on the specific, current
            implementation of velocity aberration corrections, a problem
            could occur.
 
   NAIF believes any possible negative consequences are outweighed by the
   benefits of improved accuracy.
 
   Below we briefly describe the differences between the old and new
   aberration correction algorithms.
 
   The previous SPK light time correction algorithms introduce errors by
   ignoring the rate of change of light time with respect to time. This
   occurs in two places:
 
       --   In computation of light-time corrected velocity referenced to
            inertial reference frames
 
       --   In computation of light-time corrected velocity referenced to
            non-inertial reference frames centered at an object other than
            the observer.
 
   The new light time algorithms correct both of these errors.
 
   SPICE supports stellar aberration correction only when light time
   correction is used as well.
 
   Previously, the velocity returned when light time and stellar aberration
   corrections were used is identical to that returned when only light time
   correction is used.
 
   The new algorithm computes light time and stellar aberration-corrected
   velocity as the derivative with respect to time of light time and
   stellar aberration-corrected position.
 
 
New SPK Routines
 
   To support improvements to the SPK subsystem described above, three new
   SPK routines were added (described below). In most cases SPICE users
   would not call one of these routines, using the high-level APIs SPKEZR
   or SPKEZ instead. For the N0062 release these routines are available
   only in SPICELIB and CSPICE.
 
         SPKACS   The new routine SPKACS (spkacs_c in CSPICE) returns the
                  state (position and velocity) of a target body relative
                  to an observer, optionally corrected for light time and
                  stellar aberration, expressed relative to an inertial
                  reference frame.
 
         SPKAPS   Given the state and acceleration of an observer relative
                  to the solar system barycenter, the new routine SPKAPS
                  (spkaps_c in CSPICE) returns the state (position and
                  velocity) of a target body relative to the observer,
                  optionally corrected for light time and stellar
                  aberration. All input and output vectors are expressed
                  relative to an inertial reference frame.
 
         SPKLTC   The new routine SPKLTC (spkltc_c in CSPICE) returns the
                  state (position and velocity) of a target body relative
                  to an observer, optionally corrected for light time,
                  expressed relative to an inertial reference frame.
 
 
New Binary PCK Coverage Routines PCKFRM and PCKCOV
 
   The new PCK coverage determination routine PCKCOV (pckcov_c in CSPICE)
   provides an API with which an application can find the time period(s)
   during which a specified binary PCK file provides data for a specified
   reference frame. The coverage information is a set of disjoint time
   intervals returned in a SPICE ``window'' data structure.
 
   The new PCK routine PCKFRM (pckfrm_c in CSPICE) provides an API via
   which an application can find the set of reference frames for which a
   specified binary PCK file contains data. The coverage information is
   returned in a SPICE ``set'' data structure.
 
   For the N0062 release these routines are available only in SPICELIB and
   CSPICE.
 
 
New Routine WNCARD
 
   The new routine WNCARD (wncard_c in CSPICE, cspice_wncard in Icy)
   returns the cardinality -- number of intervals -- of a SPICE ``window''
   data structure.
 
   For the N0062 release this routine is available only in SPICELIB,
   CSPICE, and Icy.
 
 
New Routine EDTERM
 
   The new routine EDTERM computes a set of points on the umbral or
   penumbral terminator of a specified target body, where the target shape
   is modeled as an ellipsoid.
 
   For the N0062 release this routine is available only in SPICELIB.
 
 
SCLK Buffer Size Increase
 
   The sizes of the internal buffers in the SCLK subsystem have been
   increased to allow SCLK kernels to include up to 9,999 partitions.
 
 
TABs in Text Kernels
 
   The low level routines called by the SPICE kernel loader routine FURNSH
   were modified to ignore TAB characters present in text kernels files on
   all supported environments.

Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Permutted Index for Icy and Mice
 
   The permutted index documents have been added to the ASCII and HTML
   documentation sets provided with the Icy and Mice Toolkits.
 
 
BRIEF User's Guide
 
   The BRIEF User's Guide, brief.ug, was fully rewritten to describe new
   features added to the program and to provide examples illustrating all
   aspects of the program's functionality.
 
 
Documentation on NAIF Web Server
 
   The documentation provided in the generic SPICE, CSPICE, Icy and Mice
   Toolkits is now also available at this URL on the NAIF Web server:
 
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/documentation.html
 
 
BRIEF
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The BRIEF utility program was modified to:
 
       --   summarize binary PCK files
 
       --   summarize SPK files provided in meta-kernels
 
       --   load text kernels
 
       --   display times as calendar UTC (``-utc'' option), day-of-year
            UTC (``-utcdoy'' option), and ET seconds (``-etsec'' option)
 
       --   detect attempts to summarize unsupported kernel types (CK, EK,
            transfer format kernels, etc.)
 
   The program's help and usage displays as well as the formats of the
   summary reports were improved. The internal buffers holding summary
   information were increased to allow summarizing SPK files or file sets
   containing up to 100,000 bodies.
 
 
CKBRIEF
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The CKBRIEF utility program was modified to:
 
       --   summarize CK files provided in meta-kernels
 
       --   detect attempts to summarize unsupported kernel types (SPK,
            binary PCK, EK, transfer format kernels, etc.)
 
   The program's help and usage displays were improved. The internal
   buffers holding summary information were increased to allow summarizing
   CK files containing up to 100,000 segments.
 
 
MKSPK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The capability to accept time tags given as ET seconds past J2000 was
   added to the program. The TIME_WRAPPER setup keyword must be set to the
   special value '# ETSECONDS' to make the program recognize and process
   such time tags.
 
 
SUBPT Cookbook
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The cookbook program SUBPT was updated to illustrate use of the new
   ``sub-observer point'' routine SUBPNT.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
EV2LIN
 
   Corrected error in the calculation of the C4 term due to typographic
   error in expression.
 
 
HYPTOF
 
   An error in the HYPTOF routine affecting cases of evaluating elements of
   a hyperbolic trajectory with a very large eccentricity with respect to a
   small body (low gravity) has been fixed.
 
 
INELPL
 
   The routine's specification and behavior have been updated so the
   routine now returns a meaningful result for the case of an ellipse
   consisting of a single point.
 
   Also, in the degenerate case where the input ellipse is a line segment
   of positive length, and this segment intersects the plane, the number of
   intersection points is set to 1 rather than 2.
 
 
RAXISA
 
   Minor edit to the ANGLE declaration strictly identifying the constant as
   a double. This change eliminates an occasional compiler warning.
 
 
SC01
 
   The routine was fixed to correctly insert spaces between fields when the
   output field delimiter is blank.
 
 
SRFXPT
 
   The routine was corrected to no longer apply the light time improvement
   logic in near-miss cases when a geometric solution is requested via
   ABCORR.
 
 
BRIEF
 
   A number of bugs were fixed in the BRIEF utility program in the course
   of the modifications described above. The two most significant of these
   bugs were hanging up when no value was provided after ``-from'',
   ``-to'',``-at'', and ``-f'' options, and a logic expression error
   causing the program's crash on the Intel FORTRAN environments.

Complete List of Supported Environments
 
   This is the complete list of environments on which the N0061 version of
   the SPICE Toolkit is supported:
 
      FORTRAN Toolkit:
 
         Mac/Intel    OS-X          Intel FORTRAN
         Mac/PowerPC  OS-X          Absoft FORTRAN

         Sun          Solaris       SUN C / IDL 6.3
 
 
Use of -fPIC/-KPIC Option
 
   The CSPICE library provided with the CSPICE and Icy toolkits is now
   compiled with the -fPIC or -KPIC option resulting in
   position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking all environments
   that support it.
 
 
Lahey Memory Issue Related to File Opening/Closing
 
   Users of Lahey FORTRAN under the Windows operating systems should be
   aware that the F95 compiler allocates a small amount of memory, in
   connection with the process of using file OPEN and INQUIRE statements,
   that it might not free at the end of the file manipulation process.
   Since the simple opening of a binary kernel file can involve multiple
   OPEN and INQUIRE statements, the result of this allocation is that if
   the user were to open many (e.g. 100 or more) kernel files, an
   application program could sequester memory that would not be freed as
   expected. A virtual memory error message such as "A work area cannot be
   reserved because of insufficient area" may result from this situation.
   This can adversely affect the stability of the Windows operating system,
   even after the user program is terminated.
 
   We believe that this behavior affects all versions of SPICELIB,
   including the N61 version. We are working with Lahey to resolve this
   issue.
 
 
Scratch EK File Issue in Icy on PC/Windows
 
   An issue may exist when using EK scratch files from IDL under Microsoft
   Windows. The cspice_ekcls call may fail to delete the scratch file
   created by the cspice_ekops call. This file normally has a name style
   similar to tmp.Fxxxxx. You can manually delete the file only after you
   close the IDL application.
 
   This problem does not affect use of the file or cause any known
   instability to Icy.
 
 
Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Starting with N0061 every SPICE toolkit package comes with a complete
   set of HTML documentation consisting of:
 
       --   brief introduction to the SPICE system
 
       --   overview of specifics of SPICE implementation for a given
            language (for CSPICE and Icy only)
 
       --   description of the Toolkit package layout and contents
 
       --   language specific summary of Most Used SPICE APIs by category
 
       --   complete reference guide for all public APIs, derived from the
            source headers and provided with an alphabetical index
 
       --   Permuted Index of all public APIs
 
       --   complete set of Required Reading documents, provided with an
            index
 
       --   complete set of User's Guide documents, provided with an index
 
   All HTML documents in this set are cross-hyperlinked -- every instance
   of an API name in Required Reading, index or other documents is linked
   to the API HTML page derived from its source code header; every
   reference to a Required Reading document in the API HTML pages, indexes
   and other documents is linked to the Required Reading's HTML page, and
   so on. In some cases HTML pages are also linked to the actual source
   code modules, specifically from the Permuted Index document and from the
   bottom of each of the each individual API pages.
 
   The top level index file
 
      doc/html/index.html
 
   provides a single entry point to all HTML documentation.
 
   While the CSPICE and Icy set of individual API HTML pages contains a
   page for each of the public routines, the SPICELIB (Fortran) set does
   not provide HTML pages for about 30 routines that are different on
   different environments. NAIF omitted them in this Toolkit version due to
   some technical difficulties in assembling the Toolkit packages and will
   try to fix this situation in the next release of the Toolkit.
 
   Also, the SPICELIB HTML documentation set does not include links to a
   small set of APIs that have names that are either common words (POS,
   FRAME, ROTATE, RETURN) or terms (J2000, B1950) commonly used in the
   SPICE documentation.
 
 
New Applications
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
MSOPCK
 
   The MSOPCK program was added to the application set included in each
   SPICE toolkit. This program converts attitude data provided in a text
   file as UTC, SCLK, or ET-tagged quaternions, Euler angles, or matrices,
   optionally accompanied by angular velocities, into a type 1, 2, or 3
   SPICE C-kernel.
 
   Refer to the MSOPCK User's Guide, msopck.ug, for more information about
   the program.
 
   Note: an earlier version of this program has been available in some
   mission-specific Toolkits and through the NAIF website. We recommend
   users replace that older version with this one.
 
 
SPKDIFF
 
   The SPKDIFF program was added to the application set included in each
   SPICE toolkit. This program computes differences between geometric
   states obtained from two SPK files and either displays these differences
   or shows statistics about them.
 
   Refer to the SPKDIFF User's Guide, spkdiff.ug, for more information
   about the program.
 
   Note: SPPKDIFF replaces a predecessor program named CMPSPK that had
   limited distribution.
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
KCLEAR Routine
 
   A call to KCLEAR unloads all files loaded via FURNSH and clears the
   kernel pool.
 
   Calling KCLEAR at the end of an Icy-based IDL script ensures that
   kernels loaded during script execution won't contaminate results from
   Icy-based scripts run subsequently during the same IDL session.
 
 
DAF Comment Area Routines
 
   The former support library routines DAFAC, DAFDC, and DAFEC have been
   moved into SPICELIB. These routines provide comment area access for
   DAF-based files, such as SPK, CK, and binary PCK files. DAFAC appends to
   the contents of a DAF's comment area text provided in a buffer. DAFDC
   deletes all comments from the comment area. DAFEC extracts the contents
   of the comment area into a buffer.
 
   These routines are available in SPICELIB and CSPICE; they are not yet
   supported in Icy.
 
 
DAF-based Kernel Open Routines
 
   The routines CKOPN, PCKOPN, and SPKOPN, which open new CK, binary PCK
   and SPK kernels respectively, now are able to reserve a caller-specified
   amount of space in the new file's comment area at the time of file
   creation. This allows faster comment addition when comments must be
   added after the kernel contains a large amount of data, since the data
   need not be shifted to make room in the comment area.
 
   The calling sequences of these routines have not changed. The routines'
   input argument NCOMCH was previously disregarded; it now specifies the
   amount of comment area space to reserve.
 
   This change applies to SPICELIB, CSPICE, and Icy.
 
 
DAFONW Routine
 
   The routine DAFONW, which opens a new DAF, now initializes the DAF
   comment area when comment area records are reserved. The comment records
   are null-padded as before, but now the first character of the comment
   area is initialized with the ``end-of-comments'' character. This
   provides a correctly initialized empty comment area that can be accessed
   by SPICE routines and utilities. Formerly this initialization had to be
   carried out by the calling program.
 
   This change supports the capability of reserving space in the comment
   area now provided by the higher-level kernel opening routines CKOPN,
   PCKOPN, and SPKOPN.
 
 
SPKW02, SPKW03, and SPKW05 Routines
 
   The restriction that the input reference frame should be inertial has
   been removed from SPK Type 2, 3 and 5 writer routines SPKW02, SPKW03 and
   SPKW05. Any application that calls there routines, including the MKSPK
   program, can now create a type 2, 3, or 5 SPK file with data given with
   respect to a non-inertial frame.
 
 
Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
 
   The following new built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been added
   to the Toolkit:

              902   NIX
              903   HYDRA
 
   The following provisional name/ID mappings for the Jovian system
   satellites were replaced or removed from the Toolkit:
 
       539         'HEGEMONE'              JXXXIX
       540         'MNEME'                 JXL
       541         'AOEDE'                 JXLI
       542         'THELXINOE'             JXLII
       543         'ARCHE'                 JXLIII
       544         'KALLICHORE'            JXLIV
       545         'HELIKE'                JXLV

       548         'CYLLENE'               JXLVIII
 
   The new mapping leaves the IDs 539, 542-545, 549, 550, 552, 554-559
   unassigned.
 
   The following name spelling correction has also been made:
 
              632   METHODE to METHONE
 
 
CSPICE Only
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New Wrappers
 
   The following interfaces to SPICE routines were added to CSPICE in this
   release:
 
      dafac_c        dafdc_c         dafec_c
      dafgda_c       dascls_c        dasopr_c
      kclear_c
 
 
Icy (IDL interface to CSPICE) Only
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New Interfaces
 
   NAIF added the following new Icy interfaces for this release:
 
      cspice_appndd  cspice_appndi   cspice_badkpv
      cspice_dafgda  cspice_dascls   cspice_dasopr
      cspice_inter   cspice_kclear   cspice_valid
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
CKE05
 
   Several functional changes were made to the CK type 5 evaluator CKE05.
   These changes affect all CK type 5 subtypes EXCEPT subtype 1, which is
   used by the Mars Express, Rosetta, Venus Express, and SMART-1 missions.
   These changes are not expected to affect current SPICE users.
 
   First change: the evaluator now assumes that input rate information,
   whether in the form of quaternion derivatives or angular velocity
   vectors, has units of radians/second. This makes the routine's interface
   consistent with SPICE conventions. This change affects subtypes 0, 2,
   and 3.
 
   Second change: the evaluator no longer attempts to improve interpolation
   of quaternion derivatives by negating, if necessary, the derivatives
   provided in the input record. This places on C-kernel creators the
   burden of determining correct quaternion derivatives suitable for
   Hermite interpolation. This decision was made because the selection
   functionality cannot be implemented in a completely reliable way for the
   case where the derivatives have very small magnitude (which in practice
   is not a rare case). Quaternions themselves still WILL be negated if
   necessary for correct Hermite interpolation. This change affects
   subtypes 0 and 2.
 
 
ET2LST
 
   The bug for bodies with retrograde rotation causing the local time to
   flow backwards has been fixed. The local time for all types of bodies
   now progresses as expected -- midnight, increasing AM hours, noon,
   increasing PM hours, next midnight, and so on.
 
 
UNLOAD
 
   The bug causing incorrect meta-kernel unloading was fixed. Formerly some
   sequences of FURNSH and UNLOAD calls could cause UNLOAD to become unable
   to unload meta-kernels correctly: in some cases, kernels referenced by
   the meta-kernels were not unloaded when they should have been.
 
 
STR2ET
 
   Two bugs were fixed. The first bug caused the routine to return
   incorrect results in some cases on calls following calls for which a
   time zone was specified. The second bug caused the routine to generate a
   memory violation exception for blank input strings on some environments
   (HP).
 
 
SURFPT
 
   The ray's surface intercept is now always set to the ray's vertex when
   the vertex is on the ellipsoid's surface. Formerly, for inward-pointing
   direction vectors, the ray's point of egress from the ellipsoid was
   selected as the intercept.
 
   The new functionality is consistent with the routine's documentation,
   which claims that the intercept closest to the ray's vertex is selected.
 
 
CHRONOS
 
   Two bugs were fixed. The first bug caused slightly incorrect computation
   of the mean local second duration, which could have resulted in a leap
   in the LST SOL counting. For landed Martian missions this bug would have
   exhibited itself after approximately SOL 2100. The second bug prohibited
   conversion from and to LST for local times a few seconds before
   midnight, in the 23:59:00-23:59:59 range.
 
   The important side effect of correcting the first bug is that due to the
   fact that LST is returned with integer local seconds the result of any
   conversion from and to LST differs slightly -- by less that 1 second --
   from the same conversion done by the previous versions of the program.
 
 
Icy
 
   The bug causing a cascade of 'zzerror_c' strings prefixed to error
   strings has been fixed.
 
 
MKSPK
 
   The bug causing the 8th input equinoctial element (DMPN/DT) to be
   assigned to the 8th (DMPN/DT) and 9th (DNOD/DT) equinoctial elements
   stored in the output SPK file when the first six equinoctial elements
   were derived from input states or classical elements was fixed.
 
 
Version 60 --- December 2005
===========================================================================
 
   The sole purpose of this version is to fix the bug described below. In
   all other aspects the N0060 Toolkit is the same as the N0059 Toolkit.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Access to High Precision Binary Earth PCK
 
   On December 13, 2005, a significant bug was found in the Fortran, C, and
   IDL N0059 SPICE Toolkits: this bug results in corruption of data read
   from high precision binary earth PCK files.
 
   A second, probably rarely encountered, effect of the bug is that data
   will be corrupted when read directly from routine TISBOD (tisbod_c in
   CSPICE, cspice_tisbod in Icy), in cases where the input reference frame
   name doesn't match the frame associated with the data in the source PCK.
 
   This bug has been fixed in the N0060 Toolkit.
 
 
Version 59 --- November 2005
===========================================================================
 
 
Rules Regarding Use of SPICE Components
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The rules regarding use of SPICE components, already very minimal, have
   been further relaxed and better articulated. Please see the RULES page
   of the NAIF website: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/rules.html for
   details.
 
 
Environments
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New Environments
 
   The SPICE Toolkit is now officially supported on Sun/Solaris/64bit gcc
   environment.
 
 
Supported Environments
 
   This is the complete list of environments on which the N0059 version of
   the SPICE Toolkit is supported:
 
      FORTRAN Toolkit:

Optimization for C/Icy environments
 
   Optimization -O2 or equivalent is now used to compile CSPICE for all
   supported C and Icy environments.
 
 
Lahey Memory Issue Related to File Opening/Closing
 
   Users of Lahey FORTRAN under the Windows operating systems should be
   aware that the F95 compiler allocates a small amount of memory, in
   connection with the process of using file OPEN and INQUIRE statements,
   that it might not free at the end of the file manipulation process.
   Since the simple opening of a binary kernel file can involve multiple
   OPEN and INQUIRE statements, the result of this allocation is that if
   the user were to open many (e.g. 100 or more) kernel files, an
   application program could sequester memory that would not be freed as
   expected. A virtual memory error message such as "A work area cannot be
   reserved because of insufficient area" may result from this situation.
   This can adversely affect the stability of the Windows operating system,
   even after the user program is terminated.
 
   We believe that this behavior affects all versions of SPICELIB,
   including the soon to be released N59 version. We are working with Lahey
   to resolve this issue.
 
 
Scratch EK File Issue in Icy on PC/Windows
 
   An issue may exist when using EK scratch files from IDL under Microsoft
   Windows. The cspice_ekcls call may fail to delete the scratch file
   created by the cspice_ekops call. This file normally has a name style
   similar to tmp.Fxxxxx. You can manually delete the file only after you
   close the IDL application.
 
   This problem does not affect use of the file or cause any known
   instability to Icy.
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Loading of Non-Native Text Kernels Files
 
   Starting with this version of the toolkit, the CSPICE and Icy text
   kernel loaders, furnsh_c/cspice_furnsh and ldpool_c/cspice_ldpool, can
   read and parse non-native text files. Unfortunately this capability
   cannot be provided in FORTRAN instances of the Toolkit.
 
   Please be aware the CSPICE text file reader, rdtext_c, does not possess
   the capability to read non-native text files.
 
 
Additional Testing
 
   A large amount of additional testing of existing SPICE interfaces and
   capabilities was performed during preparation of this version of the
   toolkit. This testing uncovered a small number of bugs, all of which
   have been fixed for this release (see Section ``Bug Fixes'' below.)
 
 
Deprecation of BODVAR in favor of BODVRD and BODVCD
 
   Routine BODVAR has been deprecated due to deficiency of its interface
   and a possibility that it may cause memory violation when used to
   retrieve data for incorrectly formed text kernel keywords. Routines
   BODVCD and BODVRD should be used instead of it.
 
 
``In Place'' Routines
 
   A number of routines parallel to existing interfaces but utilizing the
   same argument for both input and output were added to SPICELIB (FORTRAN
   Toolkit). These routines are:
 
      cyacip.for
      cyadip.for
      cyaiip.for
      vhatip.for
      vsclip.for
      xpsgip.for
 
 
SPK Segment Buffer Increase
 
   The SPK segment buffer size was increased to 30,000 to allow more
   efficient read access to SPK files containing a large number of
   segments, such as SPK files produced by ESA's Mars Express project.
 
 
EK Buffer Increased
 
   Buffers facilitating EK access have been increased to provide more
   efficient read access to EK files containing a large numbers of records,
   such as EK files produced by the Cassini project.

CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New Wrappers
 
   The following interfaces to SPICE routines were added to CSPICE in this
   release:
 
      bodvcd_c.c
      qdq2av_c.c
      qxq_c.c
      srfrec_c.c
 
 
Icy (Interactive Data Language interface to CSPICE)
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Vectorization
 
   NAIF modified the function of several Icy routines to support vectorized
   variables (in the IDL sense) as input and output.
 
      cspice_illum    cspice_insrtd   cspice_insrti   cspice_oscelt
      cspice_sce2c    cspice_srfrec   cspice_srfxpt   cspice_subpt
      cspice_removd   cspice_removi
 
 
New interfaces
 
   NAIF added the following new Icy interfaces for this release:
 
      cspice_bodvcd   cspice_diff     cspice_insrtd   cspice_insrti
      cspice_qdq2av   cspice_qxq      cspice_removd   cspice_removi
      cspice_sdiff    cspice_set      cspice_srfrec   cspice_union
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Non-standard Use of Duplicate Arguments in FORTRAN
 
   A large number of SPICELIB routines has been revised to eliminate
   non-standard use of duplicate arguments in calls to other routines.
   Though this use did not pose any problems or cause any errors in the
   earlier Toolkit versions, it prevented use of optimization on some
   environments. With these changes optimization is now used in building
   all CSPICE and Icy Toolkits.
 
 
NEARPT
 
   A bug related to the scale of transverse component of error vector was
   corrected for the exterior point case.
 
 
ET2LST
 
   The treatment of planetographic longitude has been updated to be
   consistent with the SPICE planetographic / rectangular coordinate
   conversion routines. The effect of this change is that the default sense
   of positive longitude for the moon is now east; also, the default sense
   of positive planetographic longitude now may be overridden for any body.
 
 
GETFOV
 
   A bug causing incorrect computation of the boundary vectors for a
   rectangular FOV specified using the angular extents method has been
   fixed. In the previous versions for cases when the reference vector was
   provided as a non-unit vector and/or was non-perpendicular to the
   specified boresight the boundary vectors returned by the routine were
   computed incorrectly.
 
 
CKW03
 
   A check verifying that the start time of the first interval is the same
   as the time of the first pointing instance has been added.
 
 
INEDPL
 
   Error detection for the case of invalid input plane was added.
 
 
INSRTC
 
   The routine was changed in such way that when the item to be inserted
   would, after truncation to the set's string length, match an item
   already in the set, no insertion is performed. Previously the truncated
   string was inserted, corrupting the set.
 
 
String Parsing Routines
 
   Routines lparse.for, lparsm.for, and lparss.for were modified to avoid
   out-of-range substring bounds conditions.
 
 
Version 58 --- January 2005

--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The SPICE Toolkit is now officially supported on PC/CYGWIN/g77 and
   PC/CYGWIN/gCC environments and no longer supported on SGI and DEC Alpha
   computers.
 
   This is the complete list of environments on which the N0058 version of
   the SPICE Toolkit is supported:
 
      FORTRAN Toolkit:

         Sun        Solaris       gCC / IDL 6.1
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE/Icy
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Parameterized Dynamic Frames
 
   The SPICE frame system now supports parameterized dynamic frames: frames
   for which orientation is based on dynamic directions computed using
   SPICE kernel data (SPKs, CK, PCKs), on mathematical models implemented
   in SPICE routines, or on formulas defined in frame kernels.
   Parameterized dynamic frames are grouped into ``families'' according to
   the method by which they're defined.
 
   Currently supported dynamic frame families are:
 
       --   Two-vector frames: these are defined by pairs of vectors. The
            vectors may be position vectors, velocity vectors,
            observer-target near point vectors, or constant vectors.
 
       --   Mean equator and equinox of date frames.
 
       --   True equator and equinox of date frames.
 
       --   Mean ecliptic and equinox of date frames.
 
       --   Euler frames: these are defined by angles specified as
            polynomial functions of time.
 
   Currently ``of date'' frames are supported only for the earth.
 
   The Frames Required Reading documents the new capability and contains
   numerous examples of dynamic frame kernel definitions.
 
 
CK/SPK Coverage Summary Routines
 
   The new CK and SPK coverage determination routines CKCOV and SPKCOV
   provide an API via which an application can find the time periods for
   which a specified CK or SPK file provides data for, respectively, an
   instrument or body of interest. The coverage information is a set of
   disjoint time intervals returned in a SPICE ``window'' data structure.
 
   The new CK and SPK routines CKOBJ and SPKOBJ provide an API via which an
   application can find the set of instruments or bodies for which,
   respectively, a specified CK or SPK file contains data. The coverage
   information is returned in a SPICE ``set'' data structure.
 
   These new APIs are supported by SPICELIB, CSPICE, and Icy.
 
 
Planetographic Coordinate Conversion Routines
 
   The new planetographic coordinate conversion routines RECPGR and PGRREC
   support conversion between rectangular and planetographic coordinates.
   The planetographic Jacobian matrix routines DRDPGR and DPGRDR provide
   the derivative matrices for these transformations (used for coordinate
   transformations of velocities).
 
   These new APIs are supported by SPICELIB, CSPICE, and Icy.
 
 
``L-sub-S'' Solar Longitude Routine
 
   The new routine LSPCN computes the planetocentric longitude of the sun
   (often called ``L-sub-S'' or ``Ls'') for a specified body and time. This
   quantity is typically used as an approximate ``time of year'' indicator.
 
   The new API is supported by SPICELIB, CSPICE, and Icy.
 
 
Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
 
   The following new built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been added
   to the Toolkit:
 
      Spacecraft:

      cspice_pgrrec   cspice_recpgr   cspice_scard    cspice_size
      cspice_spkcov   cspice_spkobj   cspice_ssize
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
MKSPK Processing of TLE
 
   A MKSPK bug causing the program to process improperly formatted TLE
   files without signaling an error and producing output SPK containing bad
   data was fixed.
 
 
MKSPK Adding Comments When Appending to Existing SPK
 
   A MKSPK bug causing the program, in some rare circumstances, to signal
   an error when adding comments to an existing SPK file was fixed.
 
 
Icy/cspice_getfov
 
   A bug that caused the interface to fail to release allocated memory when
   the FRAMEMISSING error signaled was fixed.
 
 
DVPOOL/dvpool_c/cspice_dvpool
 
   A bug causing the DVPOOL routine to not delete a specified kernel pool
   variable in some cases was fixed.
 
 
CSPICE/kdata_c Function
 
   A number of typos in the example provided in the header of the routine
   were corrected.
 
 
FRINFO/frinfo_c/cspice_frinfo
 
   A bug causing the FRINFO routine to treat any frame with a negative ID
   code and a frame definition not provided in the kernel pool as a
   CK-based frame was fixed. Now, instead of returning ``manufactured''
   attributes of a CK-based frame, the routine will generate an error for
   such inputs.
 
 
Version 57 --- March 2004
===========================================================================
 
 
Environments
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0057 version of the SPICE Toolkit is supported on the same
   environments as version N0056.
 
 
Icy
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0057 version offers the first official release of Icy, the
   interface to the CSPICE library from Interactive Data Language (IDL), a
   product of Research Systems, Inc. (RSI, http://www.rsi.com). If Icy was
   provided with this package, refer to ``icy.req'' document and to the Icy
   HTML documentation pointed to by ``doc/html/index.html'' for more
   details.
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
SRFXPT
 
   This new routine computes the surface intercept point of a specified ray
   on a target body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light
   time and stellar aberration. Its purpose is the same as for the SPICE
   routine SURFPT but unlike SURFPT is provides a much more flexible
   interface and computes geometry adjusted for light time and stellar
   aberration to the surface point rather than to the center of the target
   body. Therefore for most cases this routine makes SURFPT obsolete.
   Currently SRFXPT supports only the ellipsoid shape for target bodies but
   in the future it may be extended to support digital terrain models.
 
 
Support for Satellite IDs in the Range 10000-99999
 
   NAIF PCK data access routines have been modified to recognize satellites
   with IDs in the 10000-99999 range.
 
 
Detection of Non-native Text Files
 
   The SPICE data loading mechanism was extended to detect and prohibit
   loading text kernel files containing lines terminated with EOF
   character(s) non-native to the platform on which the Toolkit was
   compiled. If a non-native EOL terminator is detected in the first 132
   characters of a text kernel, the execution is stopped and an error
   message is displayed. This feature does not work with files that are
   smaller that 132 bytes or have the first line longer that 132
   characters.
 
 
Documentation
 
   The Toolkit may now optionally include documentation in HTML format. It
   is provided in the ``doc/html'' subdirectory and is pointed to by the
   top level index file
 
      doc/html/index.html
 
   The headers of a few additional most often used routines have been
   revised to correct technical errors and grammar and/or spelling, improve
   clarity, and improve examples.
 
 
Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
 
   The following new built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been added
   to the Toolkit:
 
      Spacecraft:
 
              -79         SPITZER
 
      Asteroids:
 
              2000216     KLEOPATRA
 
 
INSPEKT
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   INSPEKT was updated to generate comma-delimited reports. This output
   format can be set using the ``SET FORMAT DELIMITED ...'' command. See
   INSPEKT on-line help for more details.
 
 
TOBIN
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   TOBIN was modified to detect and prohibit processing input transfer
   files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s) non-native to
   the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled.
 
 
Version 56 --- August 2003
===========================================================================
 
 
Environments
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0056 version of the SPICE Toolkit is supported on the same
   environments as version N0055 except the following ``Classic'' Mac
   environments:
 
      Macintosh  MacOS9        Absoft FORTRAN
      Macintosh  MacOS9        Metrowerks Codewarrior C
 
   Contact NAIF if you wish to obtain the Toolkit for these two deprecated
   environments.
 
 
SPICELIB/CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------

CHRONOS
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   CHRONOS utility program has been modified to allow loading kernel files
   using FURNSH kernel pool keywords and to accept all setup information
   from the command line.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Reading Files with MAC-OSX Absoft FORTRAN Toolkit
 
   Low level read routines were fixed to make sure that the OSX Absoft
   FORTRAN SPICE toolkit can read files not owned by the user.
 
 
DAS Scratch Files
 
   DASCLS routine has been modified to call the routine flushing DAS
   buffers before closing scratch DAS files. Failing to free the buffers
   caused write errors on HP/FORTRAN systems.
 
 
Argument Checking in CSPICE Error Handling Functions
 
   The errprt_c, errdev_c, and erract_c functions were updated to diagnose
   invalid operation keyword input.
 
 
Version 55 --- March 2003
===========================================================================
 
 
Environments
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0055 version of the SPICE Toolkit is supported on the same
   environments as version N0054.
 
 
SPICELIB
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
SPKW01
 
   SPK type 1 writer routine has been added.
 
 
DASCLS
 
   Scratch files no longer have their buffered portions flushed and are no
   longer segregated before before being closed. This change speeds up the
   close operation.
 
 
SPKBSR
 
   Segment buffer size was increased from 2000 to 10000 to improve
   efficiency when handling SPK files with large number of segments.
 
 
Kernel POOL
 
   The buffer that stores distinct numeric data items from the text kernel
   files was increased. The new buffer size is 20000, which is the maximum
   total number of values for all numeric scalar and array pool variables
   together.
 
 
Type 1 SCLK
 
   The buffer that stores Type 1 SCLK coefficients was increased. The new
   buffer size is 10000.
 
 
CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New CSPICE wrappers
 
   Wrappers dasac_c and dasec_c have been added to CSPICE. These support
   DAS file comment area access.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
 
   The following built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been corrected
   to match official MER name-ID mapping:
 
             -253     was MER-A, now MER-1
             -254     was MER-B, now MER-2
 
   MER-A and MER-B names are no longer supported by the Toolkit.
 
 
DASCUD
 
   DASCUD has been fixed so that it writes a new, empty cluster directory
   record at the correct location. This corrects an error introduced by a
   bug fix in N0054.
 
 
OSCELT
 
   OSCELT has been fixed so that it computes the argument of periapse
   correctly when the inclination is zero or 180 degrees. The mean anomaly
   computation has been corrected so that it works for circular and
   near-circular orbits. The computation of inclination has been changed to
   use ATAN2 for improved accuracy. Code that could generate arithmetic
   exceptions was corrected. Several new error checks have been added.
 
 
CKE05
 
   Angular velocity computations for subtypes 0 and 1 have been changed to
   make them compatible with those used by the MEX/Rosetta attitude file
   interpolation algorithms.
 
 
CKBRIEF
 
   CKBRIEF has been updated to retrieve and display interpolation interval
   information from Type 2 CK files correctly in all cases.
 
 
Version 54 --- December 2002
===========================================================================
 
 
Mailing Lists
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   NAIF has created 2 mailing lists, ``Spice_announce''
 
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/spice_announce
 
   and ``Spice_discussion''
 
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/spice_discussion
 
   ``Spice_announce'' is intended to provide notification of important
   developments such as a new toolkit release. Posting will generally be
   limited to members of the NAIF team. If you feel you have an important
   announcement that would be suitable for this list, you may send email to
   the list, but it will be reviewed by the NAIF team before dissemination.
 
   ``Spice_discussion'' is meant to provide a forum for discussion among
   SPICE users. Posting on this list is encouraged, however we also
   encourage you to limit mail traffic to the entire list. Extended
   discussions are often best carried out with a limited distribution list.
 
   Both lists require registration, allow access to an archive of prior
   postings and allow the user to choose whether to receive individual
   postings or a daily digest.
 
 
Environments
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The N0054 version of the SPICE Toolkit is supported on the same
   environments as version N0053.
 
 
COOKBOOK Programs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   FORTRAN and C versions of the COOKBOOK programs have been made more
   consistent in implementation and behavior. User's Guide documents for
   COOKBOOK programs have been updated and are now delivered with both
   FORTRAN and C toolkits. The FSTSPK COOKBOOK program has been deprecated
   and is no longer delivered.
 
 
New Built-in NAIF ID Code/Name Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The following new built-in NAIF ID code/name definitions have been added
   to the toolkit:
 
      Spacecraft:
 
             -226     ROSETTA
 
      Jovian satellites:
 
              517     CALLIRRHOE
              518     THEMISTO
              519     MAGACLITE
              520     TAYGETE
              521     CHALDENE
              522     HARPALYKE
              523     KALYKE
              524     IOCASTE
              525     ERINOME
              526     ISONOE
              527     PRAXIDIKE
 
 
Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   User's Guide documents for TOBIN, TOXFR and VERSION utility programs
   have been added to the toolkit documentation.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Built-in Body-Fixed Frame for Pan
 
   Definition of the built-in body-fixed frame for PAN (IAU_PAN) has been
   updated to point to the correct PCK values used to compute its rotation.
   In the previous version of the toolkit it was pointing to PANDORA's
   rotation constants.
 
 
Surface Intercept Routine
 
   The surface intercept routine SURFPT/surfpt_c has been re-implemented to
   reduce loss of precision.
 
 
DAS Writer Routines
 
   DAS utility routine DASCUD has been fixed to ensure that DAS file
   structure is correct when files are closed without data segregation.
   Previously it was possible for unsegregated files to have an invalid
   final forward directory pointer. Note: this problem could not occur in
   E-kernels created by SPICE utility programs or using the SPICE EK API
   routines.
 
 
CSPICE Cell Implementation
 
   The CELLINIT macro has been updated so that it doesn't modify data added
   to character cells prior to cell initialization. This enables population
   of uninitialized character cells via macro calls.
 
 
Body Name to Associated Frame Conversion Routine
 
   The routine CNMFRM retrieving the reference frame name for a specified
   body name has been fixed so a TK frame specified by name and designated
   as an object's preferred frame via kernel pool assignments is found, and
   so that the correct name of this frame is returned.
 
 
CHRONOS
 
   CHRONOS has been updated to make sure that the iterative search for the
   nearest local midnight converges in all cases. It has also been updated
   to use the maximum system allowed file name length on VAX and DEC Alpha
   environments.

   ephemerides for up to 20,000 distinct bodies.
 
 
COOKBOOK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   COOKBOOK programs have been updated to use the highest level routines
   currently available in SPICE -- FURNSH, SUBPT, etc.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
ID-to-name Translation
 
   SPICE's ID-to-name mapping subsystem has been updated to provide
   consistent behavior across all of its interfaces. It now correctly
   processes duplicate ID-to-name mapping assignments provided via text
   kernel files. Refer to the NAIF_IDS Required Reading for more details.
 
 
Built-in Body-Fixed Frames
 
   Missing body-fixed frames -- IAU_PAN, IAU_GASPRA, IAU_IDA, and IAU_EROS
   -- have been added to the built-in frame set.
 
 
Binary architecture consistency check at run-time
 
   Binary file format consistency check has been implemented at run time to
   verify that the toolkit prepared specifically for a platform with one
   binary file format has not been compiled/used on a platform with another
   binary file format.
 
 
Long/truncated lines in text kernel files
 
   The text kernel file reader has been modified to correctly process
   truncated string value assignments.
 
 
VMS Read-Only Access File Open Failure
 
   A bug in the DAF system preventing users on VMS systems from loading
   SPK, CK and binary PCK files with the read-only attribute(*) has been
   fixed.
 
 
Version 52 --- January 2002

   Contact NAIF if you wish to obtain the Toolkit for one or more of these
   deprecated environments.
 
 
SPICELIB
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Run-Time Binary File Format Translation
 
   The most popular supported systems (including Macintosh, PC, and UNIX
   platforms) are now capable of accessing data in binary SPICE kernel
   files from other platforms directly without using transfer format. But
   note that binary files from other platforms are only available for read
   access. See the Convert User's Guide for specifics and details.
 
 
Open File Limit Increase
 
   The sum of loaded SPK, CK, and binary PCK files, all of which are
   implemented using the DAF file architecture, may now reach 1000.
   Previous versions of the toolkit restricted the number of loaded DAFs to
   20. But caution: loading large numbers of files may impact system
   performance.
 
 
SPK aberration corrections
 
   SPK readers can now perform aberration corrections for transmitted, as
   well as received, radiation. This feature makes it simple to compute the
   direction in which radiation must be emitted in order to reach a
   specified target.
 
   The headers of the SPK readers have been expanded to explain aberration
   corrections in greater detail.
 
 
Instrument Kernel Support
 
   GETFOV was extended to compute boundary corners from FOV definitions in
   the kernel pool utilizing the new ANGLES specification. See GETFOV's or
   getfov_c's header for details.
 
 
Kernel POOL
 
   The buffers that store text kernel data were increased. The new maximums
   are:
 
      Maximum Number of Variables                     5003
      Maximum Number of Distinct Numeric Data Items  10000 (*)
      Maximum Number of Character Strings             4000 (**)
 
   (*) This is the maximum total number of values for all numeric scalar
   and array pool variables together. (**) This is the maximum total number
   of values for all character scalar and array pool variables together.
 
   These changes allow the kernel pool to hold substantially more data than
   previous versions of the SPICE toolkit, which became necessary due to
   the increasing use of such SPICE components as IK and FK utilizing the
   POOL as the data repository and access mechanism.
 
 
Jacobian routines
 
   Routines have been added for computing the Jacobians of the
   transformations between rectangular and the following coordinate
   systems:
 
      cylindrical
      geodetic
      latitudinal
      spherical
 
   The Jacobian routines support transformation of velocities between these
   coordinate systems. See the headers of the following SPICELIB
   routines/CSPICE functions for more information:
 
      DCYLDR/dcyldr_c
      DGEODR/dgeodr_c
      DLATDR/dlatdr_c
      DSPHDR/dsphdr_c
      DRDCYL/drdcyl_c
      DRDGEO/drdgeo_c
      DRDLAT/drdlat_c
      DRDSPH/drdsph_c
 
 
NAIF ID to Object Name Mapping
 
   The NAIF IDs for the following missions has been added to the set of IDs
   built into SPICE:
 
      CONTOUR
      LUNAR-A
      DRTS-WC
      MARS EXPRESS
      DEEP IMPACT
      STARLIGHT
      MER
 
 
Documentation
 
   DAS and EK Required Reading documents have been added to the SPICE
   Toolkit.
 
   The CONVERT User's Guide has been updated to reflect new run-time binary
   file format translation capability.
 
   The FRAMES Required Reading has been updated to include inertial frame
   information formerly contained in the NAIF_IDS Required Reading.
 
   The NAIF_IDS Required Reading has been updated to reflect new Toolkit
   capability, through which the NAIF ID to name mappings can be defined
   using text kernel files.
 
   The MKSPK User's Guide has been updated to add clarity throughout.
 
   The ERROR, PCK, ROTATIONS, SPK, and TIME Required Reading documents have
   all been improved.
 
 
CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
New CSPICE wrappers for EK routines
 
   CSPICE wrappers have been added to support record-oriented EK
   manipulation, including record-oriented writing, updating, and reading.
 
   CSPICE wrappers have been added to provide summary capabilities for
   loaded EK tables.
 
 
Miscellaneous new CSPICE wrappers
 
   Some new CSPICE wrappers have been added:
 
      frmnam_c
      inelpl_c
      namfrm_c
 
 
CKBRIEF
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   A capability to display a separate record for each interpolation
   interval in each segment of a Type 2 or Type 3 CK file has been added to
   the program. This capability is implemented using the ``-dump'' command
   line option.
 
 
COMMNT
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   An inconsistency between the program's functionality in interactive and
   command line modes has been fixed. The maximum length of a comment line
   that can be added to and extracted from the comments in either mode is
   now the same and is equal to 1000 characters.
 
 
MKSPK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The program was modified to allow appending new data segments to an
   existing SPK file.
 
 
VERSION
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The interface of this utility program has been extended: a command line
   parameter causing the program to display additional library information
   has been added. See ``version -help'' for details.
 
 
Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
CK, PCK, and SPK segment buffering and selection
 
   Several bugs have been corrected in the modules CKBSR, PCKBSR, and
   SPKBSR. These bug fixes enable users to load more segments than can be
   buffered at once by these modules. However, the best run-time speed is
   still obtained when all segments of a given kernel type can be buffered.
   The current segment buffer sizes are:
 
      CK:    4000 segments
      SPK:   2000 segments
      PCK:    100 segments
 
 
Const-qualification for various CSPICE interfaces
 
   A number of CSPICE function interfaces have been updated to add
   const-qualification of input arrays. This fix enhances compatibility
   with C++ applications.
 
 
CSPICE function gcpool_c fixed
 
   This routine did not properly trim trailing blanks from values in its
   output array.
 
 
MOVED fix for Fortran PC Linux platform
 
   In some cases the routine MOVED incorrectly copied double precision
   numbers whose values were assigned via EQUIVALENCE statements with pairs
   of integers. This could happen when the integer bit patterns did not
   correspond to valid double precision numbers. This problem prevented
   correct manipulation of some DAF segment descriptors.
 
 
EK query processing using LIKE operator and null values
 
   Null values could be returned in some rare circumstances when a query
   employed the LIKE operator to compare scalar string column entries
   against a specified string value, and a null column entry was compared.
 
 
EK time conversion
 
   The EK time parsing code handled SCLK values incorrectly when the string
   ``SCLK'' appeared in the name of the clock.
 
 
EK documentation
 
   Various headers have been updated to indicate that query-and-fetch
   operations and EK fast writer operations may not be interleaved.
 
 
Source code clean-up
 
   Miscellaneous problems triggering annoying but insignificant compilation
   warnings have been fixed. Various files have had TAB characters removed.
   Others have had final newline characters added.
 
 
Version 51 --- April 2000
===========================================================================
 
 
SPICELIB
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Instrument Kernel Support
 
   The routine GETFOV was added to the Toolkit. It returns information
   describing the shape, size, boresight, and orientation of the field of
   view for traditional remote sensing instruments.
 
 
Binary Kernel Recognition
 
   The routine GETFAT was upgraded to use a more robust algorithm for
   identifying the type (SPK or CK) of inadequately labeled binary kernels.
   This modification is critical for Mars project SPICE customers who wish
   to use the SPICELIB utility FURNSH when loading binary kernels.
 
 
CK
 
   A new representation for the orientation of spacecraft structures has
   been added to the C-kernel system. C-kernel data type 04 provides a
   flexible and compact method for representing the attitude of structures
   by using Chebyshev polynomials to fit orientation data or models.
 
 
SPK
 
   Two new representations for position and velocity of objects have been
   added to the SPK system. Types 12 and 13 provide for the Hermite
   interpolation of states from series of state vectors. See the SPK
   Required Reading for further details.
 
 
Miscellaneous
 
   The list of names recognized by BODTRN was enhanced to support the
   identification of the "Cluster" spacecraft (1,2,3 and 4) as well as the
   Pluto-Kuiper Express spacecraft and simulation.
 
 
MKSPK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The utility program MKSPK has been added to the general release of the
   SPICE Toolkit. This allows SPICE customers to more easily generate SPK
   files from tabular ephemeris information. See the User's Guide
   (mkspk.ug) for details on the use of MKSPK.
 
 
SPKMERGE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The program was upgraded to correct an "infinite loop" that existed in
   rare cases on some platforms.
 
 
Bug Fixes
 
   Although it is unlikely that most users will notice any difference, a
   number of minor bug corrections have been incorporated:
 
       --   The kernel pool software was modified to detect and handle
            string specifications that are too long to be stored in the
            kernel pool.
 
       --   The time parsing software (used by STR2ET) was enhanced so that
            erroneous long strings will be diagnosed as erroneous and no
            longer cause a run-time error.
 
 
Version 50 --- October 1999
===========================================================================
 
 
CSPICE
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Version 50 of the SPICE Toolkit includes a C language edition of the
   Toolkit. This provides a C language interface to the Toolkit and
   duplicates the FORTRAN capabilities. SPICE users interested in a C
   version of the Toolkit should specifically request the CSPICE version.
   Moreover, C users should read the document "CSPICE User's Guide" which
   addresses issues regarding the translation of the FORTRAN Toolkit to C.
 
 
Additions and Extensions to SPICE routines
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Loading Kernels
 
   The new routine FURNSH provides a single uniform interface for loading
   all SPICE kernels. In addition, the new interface allows you create a
   "meta-kernel" listing which SPICE kernels should be loaded. When this
   "meta-kernel" is supplied to FURNSH, all listed kernels will be loaded
   into the appropriate SPICE subsystems. It is anticipated that this new
   interface will substantially ease the problem of managing and loading
   SPICE kernels.
 
   In addition to the routine FURNSH several related routines are provided
   to assist with the run-time management of kernels loaded through the
   FURNSH interface.
 
         KTOTAL   returns the number of kernels that are currently
                  available to your program as a result of previous calls
                  to FURNSH and UNLOAD.
 
         KDATA    provides an interface for retrieving (in order of their
                  specification through FURNSH) kernels that are active in
                  your application.
 
         KINFO    allows you to retrieve information about a loaded kernel
                  using the name of that kernel.
 
         UNLOAD   provides an interface for unloading kernels that have
                  been loaded via the routine FURNSH.
 
   FORTRAN users should consult the header for the routine KEEPER for
   details on the use of these routines. C users should see the specific
   files furnsh_c.c, ktotal_c.c, kdata_c.c, kinfo_c.c and unload_c.c
 
 
Position Only Interface.
 
   The Frames and SPK subsystems have been extended to provide a "position
   only" interface. The user level routines in the extension are:
 
         SPKPOS   returns the 3-vector giving the location of one object as
                  seen from another corrected for light time and stellar
                  aberration (if requested by the user) in the user
                  specified reference frame.
 
         PXFORM   returns the 3x3 matrix that transforms positions from one
                  reference frame to another as a function of time.
 
   These routines run slightly faster than their position and velocity
   counter parts: SPKEZR and SXFORM. In addition they allow you to use
   C-kernel based frames when the C-kernel does not contain angular
   velocity data.
 
   See the routines PXFORM and SPKPOS for details on their use.
 
 
ID-codes
 
   The name/ID-code translation routines (BODN2C and BODC2N) have been
   extended so that users may add missing name/ID-code mappings to SPICE
   text kernels. Using this new capability, users can extend the built-in
   name/ID-code mapping by simply loading an appropriate SPICE text kernel
   with the interface FURNSH.
 
 
Kernel Pool Enhancements
 
   Several new kernel pool interfaces have been provided
 
         STPOOL   Allows storage of long string valued variables through
                  use of a continuation character.
 
         PCPOOL   Allows the insertion of a character variable directly
                  into the kernel pool without supplying a text kernel.
 
         PDPOOL   Allows the insertion of a double precision variable
                  directly into the kernel pool without supplying a text
                  kernel.
 
         PIPOOL   Allows the insertion of an integer variable directly into
                  the kernel pool without supplying a text kernel.
 
         LMPOOL   Similar to LDPOOL, but the text kernel is stored in an
                  array of strings instead of an external file.
 
         SZPOOL   allows run time retrieval of kernel pool memory
                  parameters.
 
         DVPOOL   allows deletion of a specific variable from the kernel
                  pool.
 
         GNPOOL   assists in determining which variables are defined in the
                  kernel pool via variable name template matching.
 
 
Continuous Spacecraft Clocks
 
   The Spacecraft Clock system has been extended so that "ticks" can be
   modeled continuously instead of discretely. See the SCLK required
   reading for more details.
 
 
Bad FTP File Transfer Detection
 
   SPICE binary kernels have been enhanced so that Toolkit software can
   detect whether a binary kernel has been transferred using ASCII instead
   of BINARY transfer mode. Note that only SPICE binary kernels produced
   with the N0050 (or later) version of the SPICE Toolkit will have
   features required for this diagnosis.
 
 
CK Writer Enhancements
 
   The SPICE C-kernel writers have been enhanced to check that quaternions
   supplied to the writer are indeed nearly unit length. This check allows
   detection of programming errors earlier in the kernel production
   process.
 
 
Bugs
 
   No bugs were identified between version N0049 and N0050 of the Toolkit.
   However, users may notice that several routines have minor changes. The
   main reasons for code changes are:
 
       1.   Extending the range of inputs that can be handled by SPICE
            routines.
 
       2.   Balancing the use of the SPICE error handling
            Check-in/Check-out tracing mechanism.
 
       3.   Removal of unused variables.
 
       4.   Corrections in grammar, spelling and other typographic errors
            in the headers of SPICE routines.
 
 
SPICE Utility Programs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
TOBIN
 
   The utility program TOBIN which converts transfer format kernels to
   binary form, can now process transfer format kernels that have been
   wrapped with SFDUs.
 
 
COMMNT
 
   COMMNT now accepts command line arguments making it usable from user
   scripts.
 
 
CKBRIEF
 
   CKBRIEF is a new utility that allows you to quickly summarize a C-kernel
   in a manner similar to the summary capabilities provided by the SPK
   summary tool, BRIEF.
 
 
MKSPK
 
   MKSPK is a utility program that allows users to generate SPK files from
   appropriate and suitably tabularized position and velocity information.
 
 
Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Many SPICE documents were edited and brought up to date. Most notable of
   these is the document KERNEL.REQ which discusses SPICE text kernels and
   the use of the kernel pool.
 
   In addition a new document called "Common Problems" (problems.req) has
   been included with the standard SPICE documentation. This document is
   intended to help you in trouble shooting problems that may arise with
   programming with the SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
Version 49 --- September 1998
===========================================================================
 
   Version 49 of the SPICE Toolkit exists only to fix errors that were
   identified in version 48 of the Toolkit. The routines in SPICELIB that
   were corrected are:
 
      DELTET  --- obsolete routine maintained only for
                  backwards compatibility. A bug was
                  introduced in Version 48 that could
                  lead to 0.003 seconds of error in outputs.
      DPFMT   --- documentation corrections.
      EKQMRT  --- a boundary bug was corrected.
      SPKW02  --- documentation correction
      TIMDEF  --- a bug was fixed that can only be manifested
                  when the default exception handling is modified.
      TIMOUT  --- correction of grammatical errors in header.
 
 
Version 48 --- May 1998
===========================================================================
 
   Version 48 of the SPICE Toolkit extends the set of supported platforms
   to include PCs running the LINUX operating system.
 
   The time system was modified so that two digit years are interpreted as
   belonging to the years 1969-2068 inclusive.
 
   In addition a number of minor bugs have been fixed. The intended
   functionality of the Toolkit has not changed. The most significant bug
   fixes are listed here.
 
      conics.for was updated.
 
         There was a coding error in the computation of the mean
         anomaly in the parabolic case. This problem has been
         corrected.
 
      et2lst.for was updated.
 
         The integer variable SUN was never initialized in the
         previous version of the routine. Now it is set to
         the proper value of 10.
 
      str2et.for was updated.
 
         The previous versions of this routine did not correctly
         convert day-of-year strings in the TDB or TDT systems.
         They treated the day of year as year, month, day giving
         spectacularly wrong answers.
 
         In addition, comments concerning the default century for
         abbreviated years were updated to reflect changes to TEXPYR
 
      timout.for was updated.
 
         The previous version of this routine did not output
         fractional components for epochs prior to 1 A.D.
 
         In addition, the default time system, calendar and time zone
         are obtained from TIMDEF.
 
 
 
Version 47 --- July 1997
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes the significant changes to version 47 of the
   SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   There are two significant documentation changes to version 47 of the
   Toolkit.
 
       1.   The Required Reading for SPK (SPK.REQ) has been re-written to
            address the use of non-inertial frames within the SPK system.
 
       2.   The Frames subsystem has been documented in the required
            reading file FRAMES.REQ. This document describes the various
            reference systems that are currently supported by the Toolkit
            as well as naming and numbering conventions that will be
            adhered to by NAIF.
 
   These two documents together with the extensions to the frame system
   that have been added in version 47 allows one to easily model the
   dynamics of structures on spacecraft or surface rovers.
 
   In addition to these major modifications to the base SPICE
   documentation, the document TIME.REQ has been updated to reflect a
   slight broadening of recognized time strings and to document the routine
   ET2LST that allows the user to convert to ephemeris time to local solar
   time for any natural ephemeris object.
 
 
Software
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
SPK
 
   The SPK ephemeris system has been expanded to support Space Command Two
   Line Elements (formally known as NORAD Two Line Elements) and
   equinoctial elements.
 
   To assist SPICE users who need to create SPK files that contain two line
   element sets, NAIF has a preliminary utility that allows the creation of
   SPK files from two line element data. This tool is available from NAIF
   on an as-needed basis. This utility is still a bit rough around the
   edges and has not yet been made an official Toolkit product.
 
 
Frames
 
   The frame system has been extended to support reference frames that can
   be described as a constant rotation from another frame (such as a
   bodyfixed, inertial or C-kernel frame). These frames are easily
   described using text based kernels. This new frame type is well suited
   for describing instrument, lander and topocentric frames.
 
 
Time
 
   The time parsing software was enhanced so that a slightly broader set of
   time formats are recognized. In addition the routine ET2LST was added to
   the Toolkit. This routine allows you to convert ET (ephemeris time TDB)
   to local solar time for a planet, satellite comet or asteroid. Local
   solar time is a "clock" measure of the angle between a local meridian
   and the meridian of the sun. See the TIME required reading for further
   details.
 
 
Bug Fixes
 
   The routines CKGPAV and CKFXFM in versions prior to version 47 of the
   Toolkit dealt with angular velocity in non-inertial frames incorrectly.
   This error did not affect C-kernels that were described relative to
   inertial frames. In those rare instances in which a C-kernel was
   described relative to a non-inertial frame, the mistreatment of angular
   velocity could lead to errors in the computation of velocities relative
   to the C-kernel frame. The computation of positions were not affected by
   this error.
 
   The routine TIMOUT in version 46 did not reliably produce an abbreviated
   two-digit year. This error has been corrected.
 
   All other errors were of a technical nature such as improper use of the
   SPICE exception handling subsystem and are unlikely to have affected
   most SPICE users.
 
 
Version 46 --- January 1997
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes the significant changes to version 46 of the
   SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
Documentation
 
   NAIF now has available two overview documents that provide users with a
   higher level view of Toolkit. The two documents are called
 
      Introduction to SPICE
      Most Useful SPICELIB Subroutines
 
   These documents are available in the ``doc'' subdirectory of the Toolkit
   in the postscript files
 
      intro.ps
      mostused.ps
 
   respectively.
 
   The first of these documents, ``Introduction to SPICE'', provides a
   broad overview of the SPICE system and attempts to lay out a map of
   where you can find more specific information about the various
   components of the SPICE system. The second document ``Most Useful
   SPICELIB Routines'' categorizes 120 or so of the most frequently used
   SPICELIB routines and provides a synopsis for each of these.
 
 
Time
 
   The time software has undergone significant enhancement. The Toolkit now
   supports a wider set of time formats and time systems. The most
   important new routines are:
 
      STR2ET
      TIMOUT
      TTRANS
      TPARTV
 
   The new time software is outlined in the ``recommended reading'' file
   --- TIME.REQ which appears in the ``doc'' subdirectory of the Toolkit.
 
   A number of convenience routines have been added to the Toolkit. Those
   likely to be of most interest to users are:
 
         DPFMT    The routine DPFMT allows you to create a string
                  representing a number by supplying a ``picture'' that
                  should be followed in formatting the string.
 
         TOSTDO   The routine TOSTDO is a portable means of writing strings
                  to ``standard output.'' The particulars of formatting on
                  various platforms are handled transparently. Using this
                  routine, you can isolate yourself from formatting
                  considerations that arise when using the intrinsic
                  FORTRAN WRITE statement.
 
   The remainder of the modifications to the Toolkit are primarily to ease
   problems associated with maintenance of the Toolkit.
 
 
Version 45 --- October 1996
===========================================================================
 
   Version 45 is a quick update to correct an oversight in versions 43 and
   44. Although the reference frames DE-143 was added to the collection of
   non-inertial reference frames in version 43, it was not available to all
   of the SPICE subsystems. Version 45 corrects this deficiency.
 
   In addition to this correction to the reference frame subsystem, a
   number of minor corrections were made to the DAS subsystem and to error
   messages returned by EK software.
 
 
Version 44 --- August 1996
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes the significant changes to version 44 of the
   SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
SPK Subsystem
 
   The main workhorse routine of the SPK subsystem, SPKGEO, was modified to
   remove potentially redundant computations. As a result, some
   applications may see a performance improvement on the order of 60
   percent.
 
 
Inspekt
 
   Inspekt was upgraded to support the DEC Alpha OSF/1 environment. All
   functional aspects of Inspekt are now fully supported in the DEC Alpha
   OSF/1 environment.
 
 
Bug Fixes
 
   Several errors in the EK and supporting DAS subsystem were corrected.
   These fixes will be visible to only a small number of SPICE users.
   (Primarily those users who create E-kernels or access the EK files
   directly through the subroutine interface.) Users whose primary use of
   E-kernels is via the program Inspekt will see no visible changes in the
   SPICE system.
 
   The generic segment subsystem was corrected. The errors were discovered
   by the NAIF staff while developing new SPK data types. These new data
   types are not yet incorporated into SPICELIB. Consequently users of the
   SPICE system are unlikely to have used any of the code in which these
   errors were found.
 
   The frames subsystem was corrected. In NAIF's experiments in converting
   the library to C, an error was found in the routine FRMCHG. This error
   is of a pedantic nature and has not surfaced in any of the supported
   native FORTRAN environments.
 
 
Version 43 --- May 1996
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes the new capabilities available in version 43 of
   the SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
Brief
 
   The SPICE utility program BRIEF has been added to the generic SPICE
   Toolkit. This program allows you to easily summarize the contents of an
   SPK file. The summary can be tuned depending upon the level of detail
   you are interested in seeing. See the BRIEF User's Guide (brief.ug) for
   an explanation of features.
 
 
Star Catalogs.
 
   In version 43 of the SPICE Toolkit, an introductory level star catalog
   capability has been introduced. The routines used for manipulating star
   catalogs are:
 
      STCF01
      STCG01
      STCL01
 
 
CHGIRF
 
   Support for the inertial reference frame DE143 has been added to
   SPICELIB.
 
 
BODTRN
 
   The routine BODTRN has been added to the Toolkit. This routine allows
   you to easily translate between the names of ephemeris objects to their
   NAIF ID codes.
 
 
Performance Improvements
 
   A number of performance enhancements have been included. Most notable in
   this list is the SPICE exception handling subsystem. By relinking your
   programs you may see an improvement in performance from 20 to 30 percent
   (depending upon how heavily your program makes use of the SPICE
   exception handling capability).
 
 
Version 42 --- December 1995
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes new capabilities available in version 42 of the
   SPICE Toolkit and includes examples of how to make use of these new
   capabilities. The major new capability of Version 42 of the Toolkit is
   the official release of the SPICE Events Kernel Software. This software
   includes all the interface level routines for reading and writing events
   kernels. It also includes the event kernel browser program Inspekt.
   Inspekt has an extensive on-line help facility that for now must serve
   as a user's guide to the program.
 
   Full documentation for the new capabilities will be available in version
   43 of the Toolkit.
 
 
Version 41 --- October 1995
===========================================================================
 
   This chapter describes new capabilities available in version 41 of the
   SPICE Toolkit and includes examples of how to make use of these new
   capabilities. There are two major new capabilities provided in version
   41 of the Toolkit. First is the ability to retrieve the states of
   objects by using the names of the objects instead of SPICE integer
   id-codes for those objects. Second is the ability to store and retrieve
   states of objects relative to non-inertial reference frames.
 
 
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Until now, the primary mechanism for retrieving state information from
   the SPICE ephemeris (SPK) files has been the subroutine SPKEZ
   (pronounced: ess pee kay eee' zee). This routine requires that you know
   the integer id-codes associated with the objects of interest.
 
   Beginning with version 41 of the SPICE Toolkit the routine SPKEZR
   (pronounced: ess pee kay eee' zee er ) will be the primary mechanism for
   retrieving states. The calling sequence for this new routine is
 
      CALL SPKEZR ( TARG, ET, REF, ABCORR, OBS, STARG, LT )
 
   where
 
      Inputs:
 
         TARG     is a character string that is the name of the object
                  whose state is of interest. Examples are: 'JUPITER',
                  'EARTH', 'SUN', 'GOLDSTONE'.
 
         ET       is the epoch at which the state is desired. ET is a
                  double precision number giving the epoch measure in
                  ephemeris seconds past the epoch of the J2000 reference
                  frame.
 
         REF      is a character string giving the name of the reference
                  frame in which the output state should be represented.
                  Examples are: 'J2000', 'IAU_EARTH'.
 
         ABCORR   is a string indicating what forms of aberration
                  corrections should be applied to the retrieved state.
 
         OBS      is a string that is the name of the object to which the
                  returned state will be relative. Examples are: 'EARTH',
                  'GOLSTONE'.
 
      Outputs:
 
         STARG    is the state of the target body relative to the observer
                  represented in the specified reference frame with the
                  specified aberration corrections accounted for.
 
         LT       is the light time in seconds from the target to the
                  observer.
 
   To illustrate the use of this routine, suppose that you wanted to get
   the B1950 state of Mars relative to Earth corrected for light-time and
   stellar aberration at the epoch that occurs 10 million seconds prior to
   the J2000 epoch. The code fragment below shows how you would call SPKEZR
   to obtain this state. (Note that this assumes that you have already
   loaded ephemerides for Mars and the Earth.)
 
       DOUBLE PRECISION      STATE ( 6 )
       DOUBLE PRECISION      LT
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'MARS',  1.0D+07, 'B1950', 'LT+S',
      .             'EARTH', STATE, LT )
 
 
Non-inertial Reference Frames
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Prior to version 41 of the Toolkit, storing or obtaining states relative
   to a body-fixed frame required conversion to or from states relative to
   inertial frames such as J2000. With version 41 of the SPICE Toolkit,
   this restriction has been removed. It is now possible to store states
   relative to a non-inertial frame. Moreover, you may now retrieve states
   relative to non-inertial frames.
 
   For example suppose you want to determine whether or not Jupiter is
   above the local horizon at the Goldstone tracking site. The following
   code fragment allows you to make this determination at an epoch ET. Note
   we've hard-coded the radii for the spheroid that approximates the
   surface of the earth.
 
      C     Look up the bodyfixed state of Jupiter relative to
      C     the Goldstone tracking site and the state of
      C     Goldstone relative to the center of the earth.
      C
            CALL SPKEZR ( 'JUPITER',   ET,    'IAU_EARTH', 'LT+S',
           .              'GOLDSTONE', JSTATE, LT )
 
            CALL SPKEZR ( 'GOLDSTONE', ET,    'IAU_EARTH', 'NONE',
           .              'EARTH',     GSTATE, LT )
      C
      C     Compute the local surface normal at the Goldstone site.
      C
            EQRAD1 = 6378.140
            EQRAD2 = 6378.140
            POLRAD = 6356.75
 
            CALL SURFNM ( EQRAD1, EQRAD2, POLRAD, GSTATE, LNORML )
      C
      C     Next compute the angle between the local normal and the
      C     vector to Jupiter. If the angle is less than pi/2 then
      C     Jupiter is above the local horizon.  Otherwise it's not
      C     visible.
      C
            ANGLE = VSEP ( JSTATE, LNORML )
 
            IF ( ANGLE .LT. HALFPI() ) THEN
               WRITE (*,*) 'Jupiter is above the horizon.'
            ELSE
               WRITE (*,*) 'Jupiter is not visible from Goldstone.'
            END IF
 
   Below is a list of the non-inertial frames that are currently supported.
