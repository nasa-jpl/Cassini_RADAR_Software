/* $ Parameters */

/*     LBCELL     is the lower bound for SPICE cell arrays. */

/*     CNVTOL     is the convergence tolerance used for finding */
/*                endpoints of the intervals comprising the result */
/*                window. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary */
/*                searches for roots should terminate: when a root is */

/*                The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found */

/* $ Exceptions */

/*     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results, */

/* $ Files */

/*     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program */
/*     before this routine is called. */

/*     The following data are required: */

/*        - SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data */
/*          for the target, source and observer that cover the time */
/*          period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration */
/*          corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of */
/*          the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be */
/*          calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically */
/*          ephemeris data */
/*          are made available by loading one or more SPK files via */
/*          FURNSH. */

/*        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have */
/*          semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. */
/*          Typically these data are made available by loading a text */
/*          PCK file via FURNSH. */

/*        - FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by */
/*          BFRAME or FFRAME are not built in to the SPICE system, */
/*          one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded. */

/*     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every */
/*     time this routine is called. */

/* $ Particulars */

/*     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible, interface */
/*     than does the SPICELIB routine GFOCCE for conducting searches for */
/*     occultation events. Applications that require support for */
/*     progress reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or */
/*     refinement functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should */
/*     call GFOCCE rather than this routine. */

/*     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals */
/*     within the confinement window when a specified type of */
/*     occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as */
/*     a SPICE window. */

/*     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's */
/*     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient */
/*     use of this routine in user applications. */


/*     The Search Process */
/*     ================== */

/*     The search for occultations is treated as a search for state */
/*     transitions: times are sought when the state of the BACK body */
/*     changes from "not occulted" to "occulted" or vice versa. */

/*     Step Size */
/*     ========= */

/*     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows: */
/*     first, the input step size is used to determine the time */
/*     separation at which the occultation state will be sampled. */
/*     Starting at the left endpoint of the interval, samples of the */
/*     occultation state will be taken at each step. If a state change */
/*     is detected, a root has been bracketed; at that point, the */
/*     "root"--the time at which the state change occurs---is found by a */
/*     refinement process, for example, via binary search. */

/*     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths */
/*     of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant: */
/*     the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation */
/*     duration and the shortest period between occultations, within */
/*     the confinement window. */

/*     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and */
/*     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size. */
/*     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by */
/*     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation */
/*     time. */

/*     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which */
/*     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. */
/*     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. */


/*     Convergence Tolerance */
/*     ===================== */

/*     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to */
/*     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. */
/*     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root */
/*     has been determined to within an error margin called the */
/*     "convergence tolerance." The convergence tolerance used by this */
/*     routine is set via the parameter CNVTOL. */

/*     The value of CNVTOL is set to a "tight" value so that the */
/*     tolerance doesn't limit the accuracy of solutions found by this */
/*     routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the */
/*     limiting factor. */

/*     To use a different tolerance value, a lower-level GF routine such */
/*     as GFOCCE must be called. Making the tolerance tighter than */
/*     CNVTOL is unlikely to be useful, since the results are unlikely */
/*     to be more accurate. Making the tolerance looser will speed up */
/*     searches somewhat, since a few convergence steps will be omitted. */
/*     However, in most cases, the step size is likely to have a much */
/*     greater effect on processing time than would the convergence */
/*     tolerance. */


/*     The Confinement Window */
/*     ====================== */

/*     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time */
/*     interval within which a solution is sought. */

/*     The confinement window also can be used to restrict a search to */
/*     a time window over which required data (typically ephemeris */
/*     data, in the case of occultation searches) are known to be */
/*     available. */

/*     In some cases, the confinement window be used to make searches */
/*     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search */
/*     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively */
/*     slow search of interest must be performed. See the "CASCADE" */
/*     example program in gf.req for a demonstration. */

/* $ Examples */


/*     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across */
/*     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as */
/*     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine */
/*     specific arithmetic implementation. */

/*        and Moon. Stellar aberration corrections are not specified */
/*        because they don't affect occultation computations. */

/*        ignore occultation events lasting less than 3 minutes, */
